# Papers from Friday 6/14/19
# https://string-db.org/cgi/network.pl?taskId=BtryuxaMZp8F Protein-Protein Interaction - search trios for correlation between protein-protein interaction score of SNP with cis EQTL gene --> making protein product of same name, and see if he protein has a high score with trans gene that also has a relationship to the trans SNP
# TF comes adn binds from Regime A, and then maybe something else interacts with binding, and possibly feedback loop

# Find Hi-C data: look at HiGlass or some other dataset// don't use Hi-C data for T-cell or B-cell data specifically

# for closest trans eQTLs: SNP-Gene pairs --> find closest HI-C pair
# of resaonbly close ones (100 bp??): 1 snp 1 gene 1 trans eQTL pair, see where SNp matches in both columns. is the trans gene on the different opposite chromosome
# anti-pair: part of pair that's not the snp, ask if position is close to gene releavnt to snp
