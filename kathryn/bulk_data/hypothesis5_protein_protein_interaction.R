# HYPOTHESIS 5: Protein-Protein Interaction
# ==========================================================

# https://string-db.org/cgi/network.pl?taskId=BtryuxaMZp8F Protein-Protein Interaction - search trios for correlation between protein-protein interaction score of SNP with cis EQTL gene --> making protein product of same name, and see if he protein has a high score with trans gene that also has a relationship to the trans SNP
# TF comes adn binds from Regime A, and then maybe something else interacts with binding, and possibly feedback loop

#SNP and transgene touch each other in HiC OR CTCF is near both of them
